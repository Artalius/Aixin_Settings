# Aixin_Settings

## Who can use this?
-Does your Projector use *com.chijimlee.tyylauncher* for the settings?

-Does your default home screen not allow adding apps?


### This app allows access back into the Factory Settings, while allowing you to select a new Home Launcher


This app is for anyone who has replaced the Launcher on their Aixin Projector.

I am using "Easy TV Launcher" right now, basic and lightweight.

This only opens the native settings app (com.ChiJimLee.tyylauncher)

____

This exists so that I can have any other Home Launcher, but still get into the vendor-specific Project Settings, namely for Wireless and Trapaziodal adjustments

! Tested only on Aixin Star Q2
