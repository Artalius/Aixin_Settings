# Aixin_Settings

## Who can use this?

## Does you Projector use *com.chijimlee.tyylauncher* for the settings?
## Does you default home screen not allow adding apps?


This app is for anyone who has replaced the Launcher on their Aixin Projector.
I am using "Easy TV Launcher" right now. basic and light weight.

This only opens the native settings app (com.ChiJimLee.tyylauncher)

This exists so that I can have any other Home Launcher, but still get into the vendor-specific Project Settings, namely for Wireless and Trapaziodal adjustments

Tested only on Aixin Star Q2
this goes by many other names, my unit is specifically a Horlat Q2
