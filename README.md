# Aixin_Settings

This app is for anyone who has replaced the Launcher on their Aixin Projector.

This only opens the native settings app (com.ChiJimLee.tyylauncher)

This exists so that i can have any other Home Launcher, but still get into the vendor specific Project Settings, namely for Wireless and Trapaziodal adjustments

Tested only on Aixin Star Q2
this goes by many other names, my unit is specifically a Horlat Q2
